## Single page embedded dashboard with DuckDB

This is a small experiment to generate a single-file html shareable interactive dashboard. The idea is to bundle the js, css parquet data in the html.

Try it out by downloading the demo release and opening it in your browser. The pie chart segments are clickable and will filter the data on the bar chart and table.
