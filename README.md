## Single page embedded dashboard with DuckDB

This is a small experiment to generate a single-file html shareable interactive dashboard. The idea is to bundle the js, css parquet data in the html.

Try it out by downloading dist/index.html and opening it in your browser. The pie chart segments are clickable and will filter the data on the bar chart and table.
